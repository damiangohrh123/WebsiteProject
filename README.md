# WebsiteProject

Update: Completed this project! Manged to use flexbox to align most of the website elements. Quite confident in using flexbox now. Had to use google and I refered to older flex exercises. Still unsure of somethings. Hopefully will learn them in the future. Enjoyed doing this project.
